   <h2>Tags</h2>
   <p>Theses are the tags ive gathered so far. We have the major opening and closing tags. Document tags and whatnot. To make a list of them all would be very stressful for me right now as i'm listening to havanna. However, heres a small list. For now i'll say the tags are my biggest strenght in all this. I've come a long way with those and i really like it.</p>  
   <h2>Tables</h2> 
   <p>Concerning tables, ill say i know almost everything about making tables. However, i do have a slight issue with those column/row extensions on the tables.<br>I'll have to go over those again for my own wellbeing and of course understanding.</p>
   <h2>Forms</h2>
   <P>I'm currently on html forms. Peluwa and i have gone over it togther but i think its best if i just round up that section on my own first. to aid better understanding cause i feel like there are some things we may have skipped.</P>
   <h2>Page linking</h2>
   <P>I definitely have to go ever page linking again cause i've forgotten almost everything except of course the "blank" and the "target" attributes. i need to look through my notes cause im sure i wrote it there. other than that, if stuck, i shoulld be able to maneouver it.</P>

   <h2>Styling with css</h2>
   <p>I'd call myself a proficient beginner when it comes to css styling and whatnot. I feel like on my own, i should be able to recreate all that peluwa has taught me on the topic so far. I can do the background colouring and basic syling for different sections. I still don't fully understand that error thing that we were doing sha. I thought I got it until i attempted everything on my own and realised it was a bit of a flop. Anyway, i'm sure i can understand it if I go through it on my own.</p>
   <h2>Introduction to css</h2>
   <p>I should begin this properly by next week cause I really need to work on css if i'm gonna grasp this thing. I've looked through some websites and blogs and realised that quite honestly i have a lot of ground to cover.</p>
   <h2> Questions</h2>
   <p>How do you move your image to the centre of the page? <br> 
Other than the background colour, how do you add a particular color to a selected section of your website? <br>
How do you add text and image side by side in your website? <br>
How do you do that ordered or unordered list again?</p>
